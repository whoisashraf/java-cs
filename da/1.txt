    Discuss the nuances, practical implications, and application scenarios of the three looping control structures in Java: while, do-while, and for. Explain how each of these control structures can be effectively used to solve various programming challenges. Highlight situations where one looping structure is more suitable than the others and provide an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of each.
    In the context of Java programming, compare and contrast the usage of if-else statements and switch statements. Analyze the benefits and drawbacks of each approach with regards to factors such as readability, maintainability, performance, and code organization. Share your personal experiences and provide real-world examples where you have encountered situations where one approach was more effective or efficient than the other. Furthermore, explore scenarios where a combination of if-else and switch statements can be employed to achieve the desired outcome.
